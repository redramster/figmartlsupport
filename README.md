Flip RTL languages like hebrew and arabic.
Can deal with mixed content and will adjust font and textbox size so you can understand wrapping.

Instructions:

1. Select a text layer
2. Run the plugin
3. Edit the text, text will change as you type
**** new *****
4. You can select any other text field on stage and edit it as you wish. 
5. If you resize the field, the text will keep its original wrapping. use the refresh button to sort the wrapping again

Have fun. Hopefully this will get Figma to support this from the properties window....
